- Plan for today:
- [ ] Convert current data structure to be the same structure as we have with the normal F1 dataset.
  - Note that going forward I might want to change the datastructure that we use, so keep this in mind.
  - Note: I will keep working notes on Notion log to avoid it getting too messy in here. 


### 1/10/22

- Code for continous updates from the super taikyu website is together
- Code for pulling info from static website for the Timing Table is together

TODO next:

- [ ] Cleanup the code; write down a plan for what the structure should be like 
- [ ] Plan for testing the code that continuously pulls updates from the website. My sense is to run the html on a local server and then run code that updates the website.
- [ ] I should write notes down on HTML and CSS

- [ ] Not directly related to this project but I should start building websites/ web apps/ interfaces as some good practice.
